# MXET Resources

![banner image](img/banner.jpg ':class=banner-image')

A resource page for Multidisciplinary Engineering. Keywords: Education, Mechatronics, Robotics, Applied Learning, IoT, Fabrication

## Introduction

What is this web page for, and how can we use it?

<details>
  <summary> To students: </summary>
Dear students of MXET & ESET, if you are graduate before 2030, ZERO of your professors graduated from a multidisciplinary degree program. You're in new territory where at times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in adjacent fields that you study.  Therefore, you are challenged to balance the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.

## Feedback

Communication only works if the loop is closed.

* **Novice students:**
  * Please email malawey@tamu.edu with questions or comments.
* **Experienced students:**
  * Please post an issue on this github repository.
  * [Jump to issues page](https://github.com/MXET/resources/issues)
* **Wise students**
  * Need a new tool we don't have? Need help getting a Job?  Have an issue with your design team?  Your lab staff are the only human beings among 7 billion who are literally paid to help you directly, with your engineering career. We get satisfaction from helping young engineers. Reach out.

Why use the github?  To help students, your lab coordinators use resources from TAMU.  TAMU has a LOT of resources.  But, we can only PULL resources if our requests are backed up directly by undergraduate students' needs, and we have clear documentation of those needs.  If we have clear docs, things happen rapidly and reliably.


# Power Electronics


## Your Curriculum

Power calculation & design falls neatly between the curriculum of MXET courses.  Supplementary knowledge is added here to support your projects.

| Course          | Covers                             | Not covered |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Circuits        | How is energy calculated?          | how to power my project? |
| Thermodynamics  | Where does energy go?              | what is my circuit efficiency? |
| Mechatronics    | How to select an actuator?         | how to measure actuator power? |
| Instrumentation | How to measure one element?        | how to measure power of a system? |
| Control Systems | How to control power to a motor    | how to control power digitally? |

# Tools

The most highly recommended tools for MXET projects, and also used to build the power bench.  10 Years of observing capstone projects pointed us to these tools as the simplest collection to cover the most needs.

## E-tools

Handy sites for researching what you need:
| What you need | Site | Best for | Tips | 
|-------------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | 
| Material Properties | [MakeItFrom.com](https://www.makeitfrom.com) | Comparing properties like strength & conductivity | N1 |
| Parts Specs | [McMaster Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/nuts/) | Find key information for each product type | N2 |
| Assembly Tips | [8020.com guides](https://8020.net/product-basics) | Find instructions & examples of assemblies while you plan | N3 |
| Find a Software | [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/) | Find a free software to get a job done more efficiently | N4 |

> Notes:
> 
> N1 ► Makeitfrom has a peculiar search function - best way to search: visit google.com and enter [makeitfrom" mymaterial] with quotes around "makeitfrom" to let Google do the searching.
> 
> N2 ► Don't think of Mcmaster as a shopping store.  For many OTS parts, you can do your research at McMaster and do your shopping where it suits you best.  For example, I bought screws at Home Depot in a pinch, and since they don't come with specs like tensile strength, I found this data on Mcmaster for the same material.  Also go there to grab a CAD model of your fasteners and more.
>
> N3 ► Please do not reinvent the wheel.  Students often spend a week to design a bracket that already exists. 8020 is recommended because they share extensive details to help you plan.  But moreover, whenever you buy a cheap Amazon part, you can find its' LEADING BRAND equivalent, visit the MANUFACTURER's website, and find tons of resources that put you ahead in your design process.  The Manufacturers want you to succeed with their brand, while the distributor (such as amazon) just wants to make a sale.
>
> N4 ► It's funny, sometimes freeware outperforms expensive softwares, and this is becoming more true over time.  Also, they tend to last a long time (20 years) because the company can't crash and close down due to profits.  This site comes in handy when you operate a Linux, OS, or Windows machine and your software of interest is not compatible.  Find equivalent tools quickly and filter by Operating System.
 
# Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

## ♥ The Hugeness
Don't underestimate your project. Consider how many paths your team ventured to produce a prototype.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.

## ♥ Diagrams
Special section here to introduce [Draw.io](https://Draw.io) - What I love about this application is that it's portable, and not locked in.  Anything you build in draw.io can be copied neatly over to other applications such as powerpoint, visio, etc.  So, when you need it, it's there.  When you don't you export.

They have an impressive amount of Integrations so it's a winner in my book

# Modern Manufacturing

Manufacturing methods from 2010+ era which may not appear your coursework.

---

## ♥ Design Knowledge
This section focuses on Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the applied setting - geared towards MXET projects.

### Polymers

Polymer additive manufacturing requires knowledge of the manufacturing process just like any other manufacturing method.  "3d printing" is a misnomer as the printers and materials each have constraints you must learn.  We perform most of our printing with FDM (fused deposition modeling) and your print turnaround ranges from 1 day to 14 days. Cost ranges from free to thousands.  Knowledge is your best asset for productivity & successful prototyping.

> Working with Polymers
* Cutting & working with HDPE [A Great PDF Guide by a manufacturer](https://www.emcoplastics.com/assets/pdf/HDPE/HDPE%20Fabrication%20Guide.pdf)
* This is one of the most useful but troubling plastics.  It's very tough, very affordable, and chemical resistant, but it has a lot of "buts."  For example, YOU CANNOT LASER CUT IT, it's incredibly difficult to glue, and when cutting, it gums up the teeth of saws and blades when using typical speeds/feeds.  So, it deserves it's own guide.


### Metals

Additive manufacturing with metals is most commonly performed with a powdered metal and high powered (200W+) laser.  The process requires upstream knowledge and DFM methods by the designer. In ETID we have a lab for SLM (selective laser melting) available to students who have studied the process and have an applicable academic project.

### Methods

This section covers technical methods for producing prototypes, starting with Bonding. Mechatroncis projects don't discriminate by materials!  By understanding materials, you'll find value in much more than 3D Printing plastic and Metal, and the next step is to discover how to bond these various materials to each other.

This topic deserves a whole page for itself, so here we go:

## ♥ Design Examples
Each part has a special feature that make them examples to learn from.  But separately, you may find these parts useful in your project.

> Drawings
>
> Here are two examples of CAD drawings
>
> What does your drawing need? This can be confusing even to engineers with experience. They are audience-dependent.  That's right, there is no catch-all example of a 2D drawing because drawings are _communication_.  Asking for an example drawing is like asking for an example email.  We can show you formats, and elements you may need to include but we cannot answer the question: what does my 2D drawing need to include?
>
> Please review the examples and understand these drawings communicate to the audience: the customer, in this case.  If the customer uses this drawing to shop for parts and build an assembly, and the customer will use the parts to perform engineering, then the designer aims to include enough information for that audience to perform their task.  For a screw, they need to know how long it is but they do not need to know the dimensions of the philips head shape.  If the drawing is for a manufacturer to produce the part by hand-cutting, they need each dimension to cut.  If the drawing is for a manufacturer using CNC machining, they may only need the tolerances, not the location of each cut.  With a CNC machine, the machine will interpret a hole locations using the digital information within the file.  The manufacturer simply must know the tolerances so he can select the tooling, feeds, and speeds to achieve the requirement.
>
> In conclusion, the drafter needs to know how the drawing will be used in order to know what to include in the drawing.  And, drawings are ultimately just like any other communication.
>

## ♥ Monthly Teardowns

>
> “When you want to know how things really work, study them when they are coming apart.” - William Gibson
>

_Starting September 1st I will lead monthly teardowns in the PIC on Fridays at 12pm noon.  Participants who join will have a chance to disassemble a mechatronics machine and learn what is inside, and how it was made.  This is open to any ETID student who wishes to join._

After we see how the first teardown goes, I'll consider the following:
* Photo albums for each teardown
* Video explanations of what we find
* How to choose the next machine for teardown.
* documenting tools used for disassembly and how to use them
* crowd-voting on the next teardown

#### Teardowns by Month

<details><summary> Expand for Plans & Logs </summary>
**September Teardown:**
  **Location** this one will take place off-campus (space is not yet ready in Thompson Hall).  The distance is 3.4 miles to the SCUTTLE Lab. Please email dmalawey@tamu.edu if you would like to attend.

# Capstone
Every capstone team submits their documentation before graduation but the new teams have varying access to examples.  This section uses an example capstone team called Flobotics with a product "Ventus," a robot designed to navigate through indoor greenhouses to collect sensor data.

## ♥ Design Tips

| Tip                              | Details                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1\. Bench before you Build            |   👉 Your design contains nothing new.  Your **integration** is new.  So, find a proven design containing the same elements. For example, [OpenBuilds.com](https://openbuilds.com/), [Hackster.io](https://hackster.io), and [Printables](https://printables.com) have lots of options to explore.  |
| 2\. Handle tight deadlines in reverse | 👉 24 hours before a deadline, stop what you're doing.  Pretend the deadline is now.  Run a trial of your presentation, notice the worst shortcomings, and reprioritize your tasking based on that. | 
| 3\. Learn Assemblies in CAD | 👉 You rarely need to model parts nowadays.  Instead, spend extra time learning how to mate and constrain assemblies in your cad software, then grab 3D parts online and put your effort into the _system design_ |

## ♥ Sourcing

#### What vendor should you shop?.

Best* Sources to begin:

| Find this | here | for this reason |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Fasteners | [McMaster](https://www.mcmastercarr.com) | with CAD & detailed material specs |
| Electrical components | [Mouser](https://mouser.com) | extremely detailed data & filters |
| Electrical | [Digikey](https://digikey.com) | if Mouser doesn't have it |
| Fasteners | [Ace Bolt & Screw](https://goo.gl/maps/Xfz9QEHyTi576wtTA) | if you need local pickup. Bryan TX (8am to 4pm weekdays) |
| Custom plates | Send-cut-send | for plastic & metal that cant go on our laser cutter (provide a DXF) |
| Sensors | [adafruit](https://adafruit.com) | for components like Mouser, but ready-integrated on a PCB with example code | 
| Sensors | [sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com) | for wider range than Adafruit but less thoroughly documented |
| Pneumatics | [AutomationDirect](https://www.automationdirect.com) | for industry-rated controllers, fittings, connectors |
| Aluminum extrusion | AutomationDirect | for best price and CUT FOR FREE within 1mm accuracy |
| Paints & coatings | [Grainger](https://grainger.com) | for TAMU discount & wide selection |

> **What do we mean by the "best source"?**
>
> For students & prototypers we are looking for these qualities:
>
> A) They are experts at something:  They know more about the product applications than you do.
>
> B) They offer documents: Datasheets, CAD, and Brochures that help you choose engineering parts.
>
> C) They offer data: actual metrics for the products (tensile strength or power consumption, etc.) and offer filtering.
>
> D) They can sort by application: You might not know which polymers are food-safe, for example but you can filter by food-rated, non-conductive, etc.
>
> E) Their inventory tracking is SERIOUS.  They supply engineers with time-critical deadlines and they don't mess around like Walmart, cancelling your orders randomly, etc.
>
> F) They always have a PART NUMBER. Part number means there's a Brand, or a guarantee the part can be traced 10 years later.
