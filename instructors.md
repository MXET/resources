# Instructors

I am pinning a page here to address academicians who may collaborate. My job at the university is to support learning and I've always felt called to pay forward what I learn.

## Outlook

When we (educators) walk into a classroom we each carry a lifetime of experience and successful teaching implies passing the most value on to the students.  With the advent of AI tools, it calls for a closer look at our unique value and to ask: "what can I offer to students that they cannot find on google?".  This is the reason they have enrolled and made sacrifices to show up in class.  

I believe there are two undeniable items within the degree: Firstly, the application of knowledge and a team of instructors to validate their efforts.  That is, opportunity to test their knowledge with experiential work and having such test validated. Secondly, the convergence of resources to support the learning (experienced teachers, lab equipment, peer learners, etc).  It is not the individual listed items, but the convergence specifically.  So, I am personally passionate about delivering value that exploits these two factors.
