## EMT Conduit
The electrical wiring industry has a collection of _incredibly useful_ rigid conduit parts you should know about.  Electrical Metallig Conduit (EMT) and accessories are found at local hardware stores at low cost and high utility. Save yourself design time by adopting a standard steel tube, coupling, mounting bracket, and much more from this industry. In the below video I'm introducing some of the most popular parts, showing the characteristics, and describing some use-cases.  The retail inventory can be overwhelming so I carefully chose selections out of 1,000 options to represent the main parts types I found relevant.

## Aluminum Extrusions
Rails, brackets, examples, and SOLIDWORKS demonstration to save you tons of time. All the top information for building with aluminum extrusions - please watch before you plan your design!  The video below includes 5 minutes near the end which is a tutorial for setting up a 3D frame for any design in Solidworks with Weldments.  This method is far less work than manually arranging an assembly, and automatically produces the cut list, corner angles and lengths.  I also show you how to add the 20mm or 30mm extrusion to your CAD library, with the example files (profile and assembly) included in the download.

## Power your Prototype
A simpler, newer method to simultaneously boot a microcontroller and drive an actuator (motor, servo, stepper, etc).  This tutorial was designed to reduce the tabletop wiring and free up space while you test out multiple controllers and devices but before they are integrated in your project.  Learn to access those 50 watts claimed by the GaN USB wall adapters, with a setup that is quick to solder with just a few components.   Also find some mechanical tips for loose devices to be more secure.

## Wiring Cleanup
Components, methods, and considerations for organizing wires in projects.  It's best to watch this before you design, so you can discover parts to integrate in your project plans.
