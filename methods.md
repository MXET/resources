## Bonding Spreadsheet
As I began making this spreadsheet, I asked: what value am I adding that I could not find in other online resources?  Why did I have access to these other guides for so long, with so little success? Instead of creating another copy of a generic gluing table, this guide is intended to cover the following points:

* Exclusion of material pairs that are less relevant.
* Include real engineering criteria such as vibration resistance, UV tolerance,
* Include real fabrication factors such as time to set, shelf life of products, and how many tools are needed to perform a bond.
* Factor in the truth: nobody wants to sand every surface, achieve perfect flatness, and wipe everything with alcohol - exclude results that only work under perfect prep conditions.
* Somehow highlight the bonding knowledge nuggets that were game changing - like the discovery of what can be done with regular old PVC cement.
* Show FAILURES: describe situations that are common failure modes, and attempts I've made repeatedly which just are not reliable.
* Acknowledge that nobody wants to read a whole label of a professional adhesive product.  Try to summarize.
* Exclude good results if they only came from one particular brand of adhesive, and the inner-magic cannot be generalized very well.
* Orient the results to be suitable for a benchmark.  An actual strength-of-a-bond test that is easy to understand instead of PSI ratings found on the label
* Factor in the fact that bond strength may depend on Material A, Material B, or the glue itself.  In many cases we don't care how strong the glue is.

Ultimately, I decided a spreadsheet will not help.  There are too many exceptions to a yes/no type of bonding guide, and it requires discussion.  So, here is a spreadsheet that is halfway finished, that has some value but is no replacement for this guide.

## Anti-bonding
This topic is nearly as important as bonding.  If you can discover a trio where two materials bond securely, and a third which departs clean and easily, then you have discovered a material to use when you fixture your setup - this can sometimes be HALF THE EFFORT of a gluing project. 

**Silicone Sheets** 
* Perfect worktable for most applications.  It's the only surface I've found that I can rest a hot glue gun on, let it drip, and have a zero-effort cleanup.

## Common Mistakes:
**Hot glue gone cold**: if you bond something with a large heat capacity, you MUST HEAT THE PARTS first.  hot melt works fansastically on two metal pieces of almost any surface condition if the parts get pre-heated and you prevent the glue from cooling before you clamp the parts.  I stick my parts in a 3D printer and set the temp to 70C for 5-10 minutes to prep them.  For small parts with big glue, you can skip this:  two pennies will bond without preheating, for example.

**JB Weld on Flexible Parts** don't do it.  Hard epoxies will peel right off if your parts are not rigid.  Epoxy is best for strong materials like metal and ceramics.

**Sprinkling money on a bond** Spending more money rarely helps anything.  Your last joint did not fail because the adhesive wasn't fancy enough.  Study a little, find an answer, and try a new chemical.

**Filling gaps with no-gap glue** Some adhesives are specifically intended to fill gaps with no problem. 

**Fussing with primer** PVC primer is not necessary in many cases.  If you have to move quickly there are many reasons to skip.  Most of all, moving quickly with volatile chemicals usually ruins a shirt, stains fingers, and drips solvents on good tables.

**Not testing** What if you could know a bond performance before you deposited any glues on your nice prototype?  Welcome to testing.  Grab a scrap of your material and try it out with the 

### Undoing your Bond:
Wouldn't it be nice if bonds worked like a lock and key?  And each glue had a process to remove it easily?  You came to the right page.
