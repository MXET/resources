## Explore

Some key components are a window to discover items you didn't know that you needed.  If you use aluminum framing in your project, for example, there is an ecosystem of OTS components that can support your project and make your design easier.  For items under 'Explore', I've posted links that have proven useful over 6+ years of mechatronics projects.

## Designs

Misumi corporation offers some valuable example designs that maybe uniquely helpful.  (Misumi is a Japan-based parts distributor for mechanical components).
* designs which execute one function highly relevant in general industries
* assemblies that maximize the inclusion of off-the-shelf parts, reducing fabrication effort.
* CAD models explicitly indicating the part numbers of each component.
* integration of key actuators, like pneumatic pistons, demonstrating how to bracket & integrate
* Clear specifications for the design criteria that map to the size and strength of the parts.
* sufficient design specification that an engineer can make adjustments and successfully redesign for new specs.
* Color-coded cad assemblies indicating off-the-shelf, fabricated, and other part types.
