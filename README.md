Resources for Multidisciplinary Engineering Education

| LEARNING | DESIGNING | DOCUMENTING |

## Introduction
To MXET students: If you are graduating before 2030, then ZERO of your professors have ever graduated from a multidisciplinary program.  You're in new territory and often times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in the adjacent field which you study.  Because of this, you have the challenge of balancing the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.


# Power Bench
The Power Bench is a lab station for hands-on testing of powered electronics

## Tools
The tools in this section are great for capstone projects but also have been used to build the power bench.



## Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

### The Hugeness
Keep in mind how many directions your team has gone to produce your project.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.


### Tips
1. Use dynamic QR codes to input a file, hyperlink, or other content to a URL that you can change later.
  2. [QR code generator](https://the-qr-code-generator.com)
2. If you use Draw.io for your diagrams, we have extra tools for you
  3. [Icons library](https://qr.page/g/4l8Rh9LDBRP) for draw.io - download as .xml file and import into draw.io
4. Submit a [3D Print request form](https://qr.page/g/4T5bfQF9eAW) for desktop prints in ETID.
