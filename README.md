# Introduction
*Dear MXET students: If you are graduate before 2030, ZERO of your professors graduated from a multidisciplinary degree program. You're in new territory where at times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in adjacent fields that you study.  Therefore, you are challenged to balance the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.*

# Powered Electronics
This subject often falls neatly in between the curriculum of other courses.  Therefore, this resource focuses heavily on powering electronics.

| Course         | Topic                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Circuits       | How is energy calculated?          |
| Thermodynamics | Where does energy go?              |
| Mechatronics   | How to select an actuator?         |
| Instrumentation| How to measure one element?        |
| Control Systems| How to control power to a motor    |
| (gap)          | How to evaluate a whole system?    |

## Power Budgeting
An introduction to creating a power budget.  This is oriented to systems that are battery operated, rather than plugged into a wall.

* Instructional [video on power budget](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w)
* ⚠️Template for MXET [power budgets](https://qr.page/g/3fLXXbQFdPo) (updated 2023.08!)
  *  Get the Excel Version [XLSX here](https://lobfile.com/file/M2Qt.xlsx)
* Hands-on [instructions for testing](https://qr.page/g/IAg6YnIaPs) power with our tools.

## Power Bench
The Power Bench is a lab station for hands-on testing of powered electronics.

### Power Bench Design

The Power Bench includes off-the-shelf testers, adapters, power supplies in the power bench that come with their own instructions.  You can find them here.

# Tools
The tools in this section are great for capstone projects but also have been used to build the power bench.  10 Years of building electronics and observing capstone projects pointed us to these tools as the simplest collection to cover the most needs.

## Feedback
This system is designed for students, please give feedback using this form if you have requests.  If we get no feedback, this project gets much less support.

# Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

## The Hugeness
Keep in mind how many directions your team has gone to produce your project.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.

## Tips
1. Use dynamic QR codes to input a file, hyperlink, or other content to a URL that you can change later.
  * [QR code generator](https://the-qr-code-generator.com)
2. If you use Draw.io for your diagrams, we have extra tools for you.
  * How to Make [Nice Graphics in Draw.io](https://youtu.be/drq9eDgVSfo) in video.
  * [Icons library](https://qr.page/g/4l8Rh9LDBRP) for draw.io - download as .xml file and import into draw.io
4. Submit a [3D Print request form](https://qr.page/g/4T5bfQF9eAW) for desktop prints in ETID.
5. Getting help: [Ask questions the smart way](https://linuxsilo.net/docs/smart-questions_en.html) and you will be successful.
  * For Hardware or Software | Faculty or peers | academic or professional |
6. For the Love of God - date your work & version your docs
  * 'Final Draft' does not exist.  The 3rd version is v3.0.  The submitted version is v3.0-submitted.

## Diagrams
Special section here to introduce [Draw.io](https://Draw.io) - What I love about this application is that it's portable, and not locked in.  Anything you build in draw.io can be copied neatly over to other applications such as powerpoint, visio, etc.  So, when you need it, it's there.  When you don't you export.

They have an impressive amount of Integrations so it's a winner in my book

# Capstone Example
Every capstone team submits their documentation before graduation but the new teams have varying access to examples.  This section uses an example capstone team called Flobotics with a product "Ventus," a robot designed to navigate through indoor greenhouses to collect sensor data.
