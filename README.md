# Introduction
To MXET students: If you are graduating before 2030, then ZERO of your professors have ever graduated from a multidisciplinary program.  You're in new territory and often times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in the adjacent field which you study.  Because of this, you have the challenge of balancing the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.

# Powered Electronics
This subject often falls neatly in between the curriculum of other courses.  Therefore, this resource focuses heavily on powering electronics.

| Course         | Topic                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Circuits       | How is energy calculated?          |
| Thermodynamics | Where does energy go?              |
| Mechatronics   | How to select an actuator?         |
| Instrumentation| How to measure one element?        |
| Control Systems| How to control power to a motor    |
| (gap)          | How to evaluate a whole system?    |

## Power Budgeting
An introduction to creating a power budget.  This is oriented to systems that are battery operated, rather than plugged into a wall.

* Quick and dirty [video on power budget](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w)
* Template to [budget power in excel](https://qr.page/g/3fLXXbQFdPo) (pairs with the video)
* Hands-on [instructions for testing](https://qr.page/g/IAg6YnIaPs) power with our tools.

## Power Bench
The Power Bench is a lab station for hands-on testing of powered electronics.

### Power Bench Instructions

* [PDF index](https://qr.page/g/2fG6cJvZi27) breaks down instructions
* [PDF queries](https://qr.page/g/1FG90ytGtOp) shows what you can test
* [PDF Example Results](https://qr.page/g/LcfYDDoNz6) shows example results
* [Video - Power Budgeting](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w) an introduction to creating a power budget (advanced).

### Device User Manuals
The Power Bench includes off-the-shelf testers, adapters, power supplies in the power bench that come with their own instructions.  You can find them here.

* USB C Meter [in PDF](https://qr.page/g/2fG6cJvZi27)
* CBA (computerized battery analyzer) [version IV PDF](https://qr.page/g/2Gbm5eF5LD9)
* AC Power Meter [DIN-mounted meter D52-2066](https://qr.page/g/2Gz7zQ1hXL5) in PDF
* USB C Charging Station [120w USBC supply](https://qr.page/g/51rwPdnPbKS) in PDF
* Powerwerx Watt Meter [45A Continuous](https://qr.page/g/40KLe1ff1lB) in PDF

# Tools
The tools in this section are great for capstone projects but also have been used to build the power bench.  10 Years of building electronics and observing capstone projects pointed us to these tools as the simplest collection to cover the most needs. 

* [Crimper - Dupont](https://qr.page/g/4GNzxHf8E69)
* [Crimper - Ferrules](https://qr.page/g/2BpwMCLQKp2)
* [Crimper - QuickConnect](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/4ngaZCugpNh)
* [Crimper - Anderson](https://youtu.be/J1cP_LAW5_c)
* [Round Wire Stripper](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/2AplH9VFcYL)
* [Flush Cutters](https://qr.page/g/3ffmXrqe0EX)

# Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

## The Hugeness
Keep in mind how many directions your team has gone to produce your project.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.

## Tips
1. Use dynamic QR codes to input a file, hyperlink, or other content to a URL that you can change later.
  * [QR code generator](https://the-qr-code-generator.com)
2. If you use Draw.io for your diagrams, we have extra tools for you.
  * How to Make [Nice Graphics in Draw.io](https://youtu.be/drq9eDgVSfo) in video.
  * [Icons library](https://qr.page/g/4l8Rh9LDBRP) for draw.io - download as .xml file and import into draw.io
4. Submit a [3D Print request form](https://qr.page/g/4T5bfQF9eAW) for desktop prints in ETID.

# Modern Manufacturing
This section offers knowledge about manufacturing methods from 2010-2020 era, that may not have arrived your coursework.
