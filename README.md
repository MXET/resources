# Introduction
*Dear MXET students: If you are graduate before 2030, ZERO of your professors graduated from a multidisciplinary degree program. You're in new territory where at times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in adjacent fields that you study.  Therefore, you are challenged to balance the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.*

# Power Electronics
This subject often falls neatly in between the curriculum of other courses.  Therefore, this resource focuses heavily on powering electronics.

| Course         | Topic                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Circuits       | How is energy calculated?          |
| Thermodynamics | Where does energy go?              |
| Mechatronics   | How to select an actuator?         |
| Instrumentation| How to measure one element?        |
| Control Systems| How to control power to a motor    |
| (gap)          | How to evaluate a whole system?    |

## Power Budget
An introduction to creating a power budget.  This is oriented to systems that are battery operated, rather than plugged into a wall.

* Instructional [video on power budget](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w)
* ‚ö†Ô∏èTemplate for MXET [power budgets](https://qr.page/g/3fLXXbQFdPo) (updated 2023.08!)
  *  Get the Excel Version [XLSX here](https://lobfile.com/file/M2Qt.xlsx)
* Hands-on [instructions for testing](https://qr.page/g/IAg6YnIaPs) power with our tools.

## Measure Power
The Power Bench is a lab station for hands-on testing of powered electronics.

### Power Bench Design

The Power Bench includes off-the-shelf testers, adapters, power supplies in the power bench that come with their own instructions.  You can find them here.

Each of the above tools has a video instruction.  ‚ùó I guarantee you'll learn something new even if you are familiar with the tool.

## Feedback
This system is designed for students, please give feedback using this form if you have requests.  If we get no feedback, this project gets much less support.

# Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

## The Hugeness
Don't underestimate your project. Consider how many paths your team ventured to produce a prototype.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.

## Diagrams
Special section here to introduce [Draw.io](https://Draw.io) - What I love about this application is that it's portable, and not locked in.  Anything you build in draw.io can be copied neatly over to other applications such as powerpoint, visio, etc.  So, when you need it, it's there.  When you don't you export.

They have an impressive amount of Integrations so it's a winner in my book

# Modern Manufacturing
This section offers knowledge about manufacturing methods from 2010-2020 era, that may not appear your coursework.

---

## Design Knowledge
This section focuses on Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the applied setting - geared towards MXET projects.

### Polymers

Polymer additive manufacturing requires knowledge of the manufacturing process just like any other manufacturing method.  "3d printing" is a misnomer as the printers and materials each have constraints you must learn.  We perform most of our printing with FDM (fused deposition modeling) and your print turnaround ranges from 1 day + $0 all the way to 2 weeks + $1000.  Knowledge is your best asset for productivity & successful prototyping.
 
* [Applied Polymer FDM](https://qr.page/g/1lM33LCiZDm) explains a great deal of tips for polymer additive manufacturing
* [Design for Printing - Part 1](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/56uPKiUq0p) strategy for designing geometry
* [Design for Printing - Part 2](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/56uPKiUq0p) working with fasteners & bonding

### Metals

Additive manufacturing with metals is most commonly performed with a powdered metal and high powered (200W+) laser.  The process requires upstream knowledge and DFM methods by the designer. In ETID we have a lab for SLM (selective laser melting) available to students who have studied the process and have an applicable academic project.

# Capstone
Every capstone team submits their documentation before graduation but the new teams have varying access to examples.  This section uses an example capstone team called Flobotics with a product "Ventus," a robot designed to navigate through indoor greenhouses to collect sensor data.

## Web Page
