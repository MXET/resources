# Introduction
To MXET students: If you are graduating before 2030, then ZERO of your professors have ever graduated from a multidisciplinary program.  You're in new territory and often times, the professor who is an expert in one part of your field may be a novice in the adjacent field which you study.  Because of this, you have the challenge of balancing the knowledge expectations of multiple disciplines among your educators.  You are paving a new path in the industry and you can do it!  Best wishes from David Malawey, your lab coordinator.

# Powered Electronics
This subject often falls neatly in between the curriculum of other courses.  Therefore, this resource focuses heavily on powering electronics.

| Course         | Topic                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Circuits       | How is energy calculated?          |
| Thermodynamics | Where does energy go?              |
| Mechatronics   | How to select an actuator?         |
| Instrumentation| How to measure one element?        |
| Control Systems| How to control power to a motor    |
| (gap)          | How to evaluate a whole system?    |

## Power Budgeting
An introduction to creating a power budget.  This is oriented to systems that are battery operated, rather than plugged into a wall.

* Quick and dirty [video on power budget](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w)
* Template to [budget power in excel](https://qr.page/g/3fLXXbQFdPo) (pairs with the video)
* Hands-on [instructions for testing](https://qr.page/g/IAg6YnIaPs) power with our tools.

## Power Bench
The Power Bench is a lab station for hands-on testing of powered electronics.

### Power Bench Instructions

* [PDF index](https://qr.page/g/2fG6cJvZi27) breaks down instructions
* [PDF queries](https://qr.page/g/1FG90ytGtOp) shows what you can test

* [Video - Power Budgeting](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/RkNMzfI67w) an introduction to creating a power budget (advanced).

### Device User Manuals
The Power Bench includes off-the-shelf testers, adapters, power supplies in the power bench that come with their own instructions.  You can find them here.

* Powerwerx Watt Meter [45A Continuous](https://qr.page/g/40KLe1ff1lB) in PDF

# Tools
The tools in this section are great for capstone projects but also have been used to build the power bench.  10 Years of building electronics and observing capstone projects pointed us to these tools as the simplest collection to cover the most needs. 

* [Crimper - Dupont](https://qr.page/g/4GNzxHf8E69)
* [Crimper - Ferrules](https://qr.page/g/2BpwMCLQKp2)
* [Crimper - QuickConnect](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/4ngaZCugpNh)
* [Crimper - Anderson](https://youtu.be/J1cP_LAW5_c)
* [Round Wire Stripper](https://qr.scuttlerobot.org/g/2AplH9VFcYL)
* [Flush Cutters](https://qr.page/g/3ffmXrqe0EX)

# Magic Schoolbox
It's a "smart" toolbox with each tool provided with video instructions.  This is a self-service station that is open for all to use in the Product Innovation Cellar.  

## Feedback
This system is designed for students, please give feedback using this form if you have requests.  If we get no feedback, this project gets much less support.
[Feedback Form](https://qr.page/g/2SgVRaiX04o) using google forms.

# Documentation
This section contains resources for students making their own documentation.
* Capstone teams - documenting their designs
* Researchers - documenting results
* Faculty - documenting teaching material

## The Hugeness
Keep in mind how many directions your team has gone to produce your project.  Here is a sample of applications you may have used.  What is most critical for you to document?  Remember: the root of engineering is science and the root of science is repeatability of results.

## Tips
1. Use dynamic QR codes to input a file, hyperlink, or other content to a URL that you can change later.
  * [QR code generator](https://the-qr-code-generator.com)
2. If you use Draw.io for your diagrams, we have extra tools for you.
  * How to Make [Nice Graphics in Draw.io](https://youtu.be/drq9eDgVSfo) in video.
  * [Icons library](https://qr.page/g/4l8Rh9LDBRP) for draw.io - download as .xml file and import into draw.io
4. Submit a [3D Print request form](https://qr.page/g/4T5bfQF9eAW) for desktop prints in ETID.

## Diagrams
Special section here to introduce [Draw.io](https://Draw.io) - What I love about this application is that it's portable, and not locked in.  Anything you build in draw.io can be copied neatly over to other applications such as powerpoint, visio, etc.  So, when you need it, it's there.  When you don't you export.

They have an impressive amount of Integrations so it's a winner in my book

# Capstone Example
Every capstone team submits their documentation before graduation but the new teams have varying access to examples.  This section uses an example capstone team called Flobotics with a product "Ventus," a robot designed to navigate through indoor greenhouses to collect sensor data.
