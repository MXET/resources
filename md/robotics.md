### HEBI
The HEBI is a modular robot system that balances high performance and affordability.  In 2018 the MXET program ordered a HEBI set with 6 actuators to be used in laboratory lessons and various projects.

A User Manual was authored by student Jeffrey Watts with edits by lab coordinator David Malawey.
