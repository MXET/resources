# Analogy
All of our digital messages arrive in the real world, if they operate as intended.  They can be productive or catastrophic.  This article is an analogy to rethink how we use our communicatin.

## Emails & Text
## Email
Email with your message in the body is a piece of paper on the recipient's desk.  If they're a busy person, the desk is filled with other papers too.  Will they respond?
## Text
A text message is a sticky note.  You place the note wherever the person is.  If you text your pal in class - the note lands on her chair.  If she's in the car, it lands on her steering wheel.  If she's asleep, it lands on her bedside table.
## Attachment
If you attach a copy of a photo, the photo is also printed out and placed on the desk. If you attach a PDF of a book, that book also lands on the desk, full-size.
## Link
If you put a link to the same pdf, it's a comment on the paper that says where they can see the photo or book later.  It's permanently written along with the message.

## The recipient
Now I have a photo on my desk.  I want to look at it later.  But it has no name, date, or action item.   If I save that in my hard drive I've got to name it to recall the point.  I must create a folder if I want to recall what project it's for.
