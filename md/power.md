## ♥ Power Measurement
We built you a **Power Bench** station for hands-on testing of powered electronics. The Bench includes testers, adapters, power supplies in the power bench that come with their own instructions shared below.  The components are affordable off-the-shelf tech that you might also buy for your project.

### Power Test Bench

For design teams to evaluate electronics & hardware power delivery, consumption, and storage.  Use the provided equipment to set up your own experiment, to measure:
1) How much power does my device use in different operating conditions?
2) Can I source power from my embedded board for an array of sensors?
3) Which battery capacity is necessary to run my system for 1 hour?

Beyond this, discover answers in your troubleshooting:
1) Is my USB cable delivering the expected voltage level?
2) Does my battery voltage drop too low when I am drawing current?
3) Is there a loss of voltage or current in my power converter?

Problems that were solved using the bench (examples):
1) A raspberry Pi resets during operation when a camera or sensor is activated.
2) The battery has sufficient capacity but the voltage is lower than expected during operation.
3) The brushless motor generates noise that interrups our signal lines.
