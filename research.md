## Torque testing project

This project was initiated to develop a novel torque testing method including an aparatus, formulas, & use cases.

### Stage 1 Purpose
The project purpose is for solving new problems (fixed criteria) and exploration (flexible & open) in bonding materials, printing materials, and mating components in assemblies

*To solve the following problems:*
1) specifically test shear, torque-induced shear, and common true failure modes for additive materials
2) design a test that can rapidly inform on comparative results, ie: is the bonded joint stronger than the material?
3) design a test which accomodates variations in parts which reflect real-world variations
5) develop a test which leverages common tools
6) examine shear failure for anisotropic parts and assemblies
7) standardize a test geometry which is easily repeated
8) make test such that samples do not require fine tolerance for fairly accurate results
9) reduce the materials

*To support exploration of the following*
1)
