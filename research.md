## Torque testing project

This project was initiated to develop a novel torque testing method including an aparatus, formulas, & use cases.

### Stage 1 Purpose
The project purpose is for solving new problems (fixed criteria) and exploration (flexible & open) in bonding materials, printing materials, and mating components in assemblies

*To solve the following problems:*
1) specifically test shear, torque-induced shear, and common true failure modes for additive materials
2) design a test that can rapidly inform on comparative results, ie: is the bonded joint stronger than the material?
3) design a test which accomodates variations in parts which reflect real-world variations
5) develop a test which leverages common tools
6) examine shear failure for anisotropic parts and assemblies
7) standardize a test geometry which is easily repeated
8) make test such that samples do not require fine tolerance for fairly accurate results
9) reduce the materials

*To support exploration of the following*
1)

  <summary> Figure 1 The basic test assembly is simple and easy to adapt.   A 3D printed fixture can be mounted in an ordinary vise & torque is measured with a beam-style torque wrench.  Finer instruments can be used if needed. </summary>

Figure 3: 
This is an example test case:  two parts bonded with adhesive.  The test can evaluate the strength of the bond.  With zero instrumentation, we can evaluate if the bond is greater than or less than the strength of the materials.  With instrumentation, we can evaluate the failure torque.  With analysis, we can evaluate the shear loads for failure.
