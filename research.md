## Torque testing project

This project was initiated to develop a novel torque testing method including an aparatus, formulas, & use cases.

### Background:
3D printed parts are frequently evaluated for mechanical properties.  The most common tests, such as dog-bone tension testing (ASTM D638), were designed for traditionally manufactured parts.  We can better accomodate our designers' needs by considering real-world 3d printing design problems.  Designers face:
* I am bonding an FDM part to a rigid structure.  Is my bond strong enough?
* I am mating two FDM parts.  What geometry is best for the mating interface?
* My FDM part can be stronger, but there are too many variables to test.  Should we add adhesive area, flanges & fasteners, ribs, etc?
* Round parts enhancement:
  * Can I enhance my slip-ring with the new capabilities of 3D geometry?
  * Can I enhance a fluid-carrying interface?
  * Can I enhance a rotating coupling?

The project purpose is for solving new problems (fixed criteria) and exploration (flexible & open) in bonding materials, printing materials, and mating components in assemblies

### Problems:
*To solve the following problems:*
1) specifically test shear, torque-induced shear, and common true failure modes for additive materials.
2) design a test that can rapidly inform on comparative results, ie: is the bonded joint stronger than the material?
3) design a test which accomodates variations in parts which reflect real-world variations.
5) develop a test which leverages common tools.
6) examine shear failure for anisotropic parts and assemblies.
7) standardize a test geometry which is easily repeated.
8) make test such that samples do not require fine tolerance for fairly accurate results.
9) reduce the number of sample parts to collect a range of data.

### Exploration:
*To support exploration of the following*
1) what insights can we discover in 3D printing parameters such as infill patterns with a test that loads the part in multiple directions?
2) How closely does the shear surface map to the theoretical shear locations?
3) Can we modify the interface such that we can assume a constant shear value at all surface locations (thin-tube-assumption)?
4) Can we use test results to feedback into geometry optimization for interconnected parts?

The test geometry should not be considered fixed.  With digital control of the geometry, we should consider

  Figure 1 The basic test assembly is simple and easy to adapt.   A 3D printed fixture can be mounted in an ordinary vise & torque is measured with a beam-style torque wrench.  Finer instruments can be used if needed. <br />

Figure 2: Bonded Parts

  Initial trials involve two parts and a bonded zone for evaluation of a joint.  The primary goal is to discover if the bond has equal strength to the parts, to be found in the failure location.
