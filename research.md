## Torque testing project

This project was initiated to develop a novel torque testing method including an aparatus, formulas, & use cases.

### Problems:
The project purpose is for solving new problems (fixed criteria) and exploration (flexible & open) in bonding materials, printing materials, and mating components in assemblies

*To solve the following problems:*
1) specifically test shear, torque-induced shear, and common true failure modes for additive materials
2) design a test that can rapidly inform on comparative results, ie: is the bonded joint stronger than the material?
3) design a test which accomodates variations in parts which reflect real-world variations
5) develop a test which leverages common tools
6) examine shear failure for anisotropic parts and assemblies
7) standardize a test geometry which is easily repeated
8) make test such that samples do not require fine tolerance for fairly accurate results
9) reduce the materials

### Exploration:
*To support exploration of the following*
1) what insights can we discover in 3D printing parameters such as infill patterns with a test that loads the part in multiple directions?
2) How closely does the shear surface map to the theoretical shear locations?
3) Can we modify the interface such that we can assume a constant shear value at all surface locations (thin-tube-assumption)?
4) Can we use test results to feedback into geometry optimization for interconnected parts?
5) Can we
