Microcontrollers Resources

(December 2025) I am posting a compilation of microcontrollers & sensors from my self-study and device trials.  This is nearly 10 years of self-study packaged in one PDF.  But, I'm also sharing the source files in PPTX so you can neatly make notes for your own projects.

While I tested out popular sensors and MCUs between 2016 and 2025 I wrote my own notes to record the wiring layouts.  Now, we can use AI to enhance these for the first time ever.  So, I made some minor improvements to reach a quality level worth sharing.

Specifically, it's very challenging to produce clean images of the microcontrollers, which you find on many tutorial sites like LastMinuteEngineers where the quality of the diagram is the difference between a successful trial and another confusing waste of time.

## Help Wanted
You can see this was a great deal of work before AI was available.  By now, getting help could be much easier.  I would like to transform the above project into a uniform set of source documents for the world.  If you wish to help improve this resources, please find my discord and hop into the community!
